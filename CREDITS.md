### Hanviet credits

The code for the Hanviet Chrome extension was forked almost verbatim from the
popular Zhongwen extension by Christian Schiller (original credits below).

UI adapted for Vietnamese and Han Viet dictionary data compiled by Liên Hoàng.

Han Viet dictionary data is pulled from the following sources (manually edited to better handle heteronyms, and abridged to suit the popup format):

* Hán Việt Tự Điển Thiều Chửu (http://vietnamtudien.org/thieuchuu/)

* Tự Điển Chữ Nôm (http://nomfoundation.org)

Font used in icons: UTM Thư pháp Thiên Ân, designed by Đinh Kiên.


### Zhongwen credits

The Zhongwen Chrome extension was written by Christian Schiller with
contributions from the following people:

* Todd Rudick (http://rikaixul.mozdev.org/)

* Jonathan Zarate (http://www.polarcloud.com/)

* Erek Speed (http://code.google.com/p/rikaikun/)

* Lenoard Lausen (https://github.com/leezu)

Furthermore, Zhongwen would not be possible without the work of all the editors
who put together, and constantly improve and update, the
CC-CEDICT dictionary: https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict

I also want to thank John Pasden from AllSet Learning
(https://www.allsetlearning.com/about/) for creating, and suggesting
Zhongwen be integrated with, the Chinese Grammar Wiki.
(https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/)

Thanks also to Nick Winter from Skritter for his assistance with
setting up the API for integrating Zhongwen with Skritter.
